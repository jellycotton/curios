# Curios

üáØüáµ Êó•Êú¨Ë™ûÁâà ‚Üí [README.md](./README.md)

> Connect your curiosity with AI.

## Concept
Curios is an **open AI integration framework designed to allow users to freely embed, modify, and experiment with AI check functions**.  
It‚Äôs built as a browser extension that performs AI analysis on text within web pages, and the fact-checking feature is just **one example** of its potential.

Through this framework, you can bring your curiosity to life by experimenting with various AI models, logics, and building your own unique UI.

## From the Developer
This project was conceived and designed by me (Jelly),  
and almost all the implementation, refinement, and adjustment were shaped with the help of AI assistants.

I am a developer with no prior knowledge.

That‚Äôs why I use tools like AI,  
learning, trying, and transforming ideas into reality as I go.

Curios is one example of such practice.

## Current Limitations and Notes

- The models are trained up to a certain point (e.g., mid-2024) and may not cover the latest events or breaking news.
- Web search results are not always the latest or most accurate, and due to biases or retrieval errors, AI may provide incorrect assessments.
- **Therefore, always treat AI outputs as reference only and perform human verification and additional research for critical decisions.**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important: Check your API subscription details**

Using Google Gemini API and Google Custom Search API requires an account on Google Cloud or Google AI Studio.  
Free tiers, pay-as-you-go, and monthly plans differ by service and configuration.  
**Please ensure you check the official documentation on limits and pricing before obtaining and using API keys to avoid unexpected charges.**

## Demo

Below is a demo of Curios in action.

![Curios Demo](./demo.gif)

## Overview
Currently, Curios operates as a browser extension that performs fact-checking on web page text using Google Generative AI (gemini-2.5-pro, gemini-2.5-flash, etc.) and Google Custom Search API.  
It verifies the accuracy of user-selected or long-pressed text and overlays the results on the web page.

## Notes
While Curios comes with a fact-checking demo,  
by modifying the server-side prompts (`server.js`),  
you can freely change it to summarization, translation, sentiment analysis, and other AI check functions.

**Examples of possible extensions (user customizations)**
‚úÖ Article truth analysis ‚Üí Bias detection or fake news handling  
‚úÖ Product review analysis ‚Üí Auto-summary or sentiment scoring  
‚úÖ SNS support ‚Üí Harassment detection or misinformation warnings  
‚úÖ Code assistance ‚Üí AI explanations or refactoring suggestions for selected code  
‚úÖ Educational support ‚Üí Simplified rephrasing or quiz generation from text

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Vite  
- **Backend**: Node.js (Express.js)  
- **AI**: Google Generative AI (e.g., gemini-2.5-pro)  
- **Web Search**: Google Custom Search API  
- **Browser Extension**: Manifest V3

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone [repository URL]
cd curios
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set environment variables
Create a `.env` file and add:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_Gemini_API_key
CUSTOM_SEARCH_API_KEY=your_Custom_Search_API_key
CSE_ID=your_Custom_Search_Engine_ID
```

### 4. Start the backend server
```bash
npm start
```

### 5. (Optional) Start the frontend development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 6. Install the browser extension
1. Go to `chrome://extensions`  
2. Turn on Developer Mode  
3. Click ‚ÄúLoad unpacked‚Äù and select the project root

## Customization & Experimentation
- `server.js`: Change AI models, prompts, API integrations  
- `content.js`: Modify event detection, overlay UI  
- `App.jsx`: Modify popup UI, data transmission

**Example for changing AI model**
Edit the following in `server.js`:
```js
const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: "gemini-2.5-pro" });
```
For the latest model names, refer to Google Gemini API top page (https://ai.google.dev/) or Google Cloud Vertex AI docs (https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai).
